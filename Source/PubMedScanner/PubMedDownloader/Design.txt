Design Notes
============

This processed the identified PubMed Ids from PubMed Scanner and downloads the summaries (as XML) into individual files.

The file names are passed as command line args.


  <appSettings>
    <add key="SummaryFolder" value="summaries"/>
  </appSettings>

Determines where the files are placed. 

These files can now be scanned by textual analysis tools to discard because of stop words, or sent to manual review.
Ideally, the manual review will be in the context of a program that parses key phrases from the contents


The input file looks like
