Design Notes
============

This is intended to identified PubMed Ids that contains any key words from a list of key word file.

For MicrobiomePrescription, the master list are the order/family/genus names of bacteria of interest 
See MicrobiomePrescriptionKeyWords.txt

The highest PMID is saved to a file so a new scan will only look for higher numbers

The new PMIDs are added to a new dated files. 

This is used by a different console application to retrieve the summaries (and full text when available) to a file
for processing by a text analysis program. Ideally, many of the summaries can be rejected by identifying key words.

	For microbiome, the exclude words included items like sceptic, sewage

It is recommended that the list of PMIDs be stored in a database with Reviewed (true,false)


Example Output
==============
Starting Scan
myalgic encephalomyelitis returned 934 items
long covid returned 415 items
Full Scan returned 1300 new items listed in Results\20210731135533.pmid

Note that 934 + 414= 1349 items but only 1300 were saved. 49 had both terms,

The output file looks like 
34327929
34326841
34323089
34321226
34315375
34314990
